## My process
- Before I started writing the code for this project, I looked at all the designs and decided to write down the different methods I could use to get the desired layout.
- Two of the most efficient methods I settled for were Flexbox and Grid. I later settled for Flexbox because it was easier for me to use. 
- After putting down the basic requirements on paper, I started coding the site. I finished with the HTML code within 30 minutes. I grouped the entire page into sections like the main container, flex container, image container and text containers. I also added classes to specific elements that needed styling in the CSS code.
- After that I added CSS to the page step by step, starting from the largest containers(`main-container`) to the smallest(`price-container`). I added CSS in a mobile-first workflow, which means that I started designing for mobile screens, before adding media queries for the largeer screens.
- At the end of all the coding, I pushed the code to Github and deployed on [Netlify], [Heroku] or [Vercel].

### Built with
In the course of building this project, I made use of the following tools:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- For testing the responsiveness, I used Google Chrome developer Tools

### What I learned
- I learned how to make change border radius of an element.
- I also learned how to write media queries and test them in a browser.

### Continued development
- In future projects, I'd like to work on color selection, mobile design and animations. This would help me create visually appealing, responsive designs.
